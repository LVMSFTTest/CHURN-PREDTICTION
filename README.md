# CHURN-PREDTICTION

**Business Objective**

AnE Commercecompanyor DTH (you can choose either of these two domains) provider is facing a lot of competition in the current market and it has become a challenge to retain the existing customers in the current situation. Hence, the company wants to develop a model through which they can do churn prediction of the accounts and provide segmented offers to the potential churners. In this company,account churn is a major thing because 1 account can have multiple customers. hence by losing one account the company might be losing more than one customer.You have been assigned to develop a churn prediction model for this company and provide business recommendations on the campaign. Your campaign suggestion should be unique and be very clear on the campaign offer because your recommendation will go through the revenue assurance team. If they find that you are giving al ot of free(or subsidized)stuff thereby making a loss to the company; they are not going to approve your recommendation. Hence be very careful while providing campaign recommendation.


Welcome to the Churn Prediction Model Repository! This repository contains Python code and notebooks for building churn prediction models using various machine learning algorithms. Below is an overview of the contents:

## Contents:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the dataset to understand its structure, identify patterns, and gain insights into factors influencing churn.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Employ techniques to create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.

3. **Machine Learning Algorithms:**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
   - SMOTE for handling imbalanced data
   - Naive Bayes
   - Boosting Algorithms

4. **Feature Encoding:** Encode categorical variables for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilize grid search for optimizing model parameters to enhance predictive accuracy.

6. **Cross-Validation:** Implement cross-validation techniques to evaluate model performance robustly.

7. **Model Tuning:** Fine-tune models for optimal performance and generalization on unseen data.

## Repository Structure:

- **/notebooks:** Contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the step-by-step process of building and evaluating churn prediction models.

- **/data:** Dataset files used for training and testing the models.
